2/12/18 Kirti Notes:

On graphs:
- Not exactly right...
- Currently the graphs are printing for aggregate of all boundarys.
- What we want to happen:
	- Click in boundary and create the graphs based on the tiff files
	  that exist in that region.

on other stuff:
- Kirti will send screen shots of current graphs to Matt (USFS) for feedback
